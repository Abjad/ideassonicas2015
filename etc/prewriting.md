Ways in which either music or composition are already collaborative. Ways in
which composers exist in ecologies of production. the work is fundamentally
collaboration. The rationalist impulse of the 20th century got excited about
changing that with the advent of electroacoustic music. That is now passed and
we have returned to a present moment where composition is inherently
collaborative.

Putting an intermediate graphic object between people is inherently
collaboration. A graphic object destined for interpretation over even vast
swaths of time. (Nelson Goodman and the distinction between autography and
allography. It would appear that allography is an indicator of the mandatory
need for collaboration.)

In this particular context, we are talking in a bounded way about collaboration
in the *creation* of the works of art.

When seen in this perspective, there is weird historical baggage that suggests
that content provided by the composer has primacy above content provided by the
performer. (Of course there are various ways that late-20th-century
developments problematize this historical baggage. It is no longer the case
that the rhythms of complexist music are transmitting exact performance
instructions. This would appear to be a late-20th-century shift in the
ontological status of the musical work. Is the work a repository that conveys
authorship? Or is the work an artifact that exists in the musical or cultural
ecology?)
