**The hidden collaborative history of composition: "actually, composition has
been collaborative all along ... and we're just now noticing the fact."** Ways
in which either music or composition are already collaborative. Ways in which
composers exist in ecologies of production. The work is fundamentally
collaborative. The rationalist impulse of the 20th century got excited about
changing that with the advent of electroacoustic music. That is now passed and
we have returned to a present moment where composition is inherently
collaborative. The advent of electroacoustic music is already collaborative
between composers and engineers.

Putting an intermediate graphic object between people is inherently
collaboration. A graphic object destined for interpretation over even vast
swaths of time. (Nelson Goodman and the distinction between autography and
allography. It would appear that allography is an indicator of the mandatory
need for collaboration.)

When seen in this perspective, there is weird historical baggage that suggests
that content provided by the composer has primacy above content provided by the
performer. (Of course there are various ways that late-20th-century
developments problematize this historical baggage. This would appear to be a
late-20th-century shift in the ontological status of the musical work. Refer to
John Butt's "Playing with History." It becomes a problem for 20th-century
thought that there's not a historically constant ontology of the musical work.
Is the work a repository that conveys authorship? Or is the work an artifact
that exists in the musical or cultural ecology?)

### RESPONSES TO PROMPT ###

PROMPT: "Global interconnectedness and its tools reveal endless positions on
the stage of contemporary artistic creation: at one extreme we find the defense
of the creator’s lonely work process; on the other, the eminent search for
intersections that enable collaborative processes between artists from
different disciplines, fields and contexts."

Does global connectedness really "reveal endless positions on the stage of
contemporary artistic creation"? We can argue it does not. Why? Because the
interfaces to so many different software packages are essentially the same. We
express a core frustration with how few propositions have been made in the last
few decades.

Take workflows. We can think about this in terms of coupling workflows and
technologies throughout history? Hildegard: person talks about angels and
writes things down on parchement. At some point instruments: people at pianos
writing things down. Then weird one-off situations: Verdi attempts to get
people to collaborate on a piece; Mozart dies: somebody else completes a
requieum or an opera. (So "posthumous collaboration" has been a phenomenon.)

What about orchestration? Composers collaborate with orchestrators in the film
industry. What about before then? First orchestration course at the Paris
Conservatory was not taught until around the 1870s.

Can we think of collaboration as a type of crack in some edifice that has been
slowly spreading? Has the task of composition become too complicated to be
carried out by one person?

Why collaborate? What are the varous value propositions that collaboration
offers to composers throughout history? Efficiency? Mutuality of expertise: the
case in opera is clear: librettist, composer, impresario, and so on. The
conclusion here is that when we combine media then collaboration is taken as
necessary. But that when working within a single medium the need for
collaboration does not necessarily arise.

There are different types of collaborative process. Multiple people writing a
single score (which is extremely unusual). Can be editor or director working
together with a composer to tailor the parts of a score to a larger project:
this is the standard case film. In what contexts of music qua music do we find
the contexts of editorial oversight? There is the iterative relationship of
experiencing performances: Mahler used to site in the hall, listen to
rehearsals of his music and reorchestrate as he listened.

James Scott wrote "Seeing Like a State." The from-above rational planning
impulse. Certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed. Top-down
rationalist planning can only ever be parasitic on in-time métis. Consider the
work-to-rule strike: workers shut down a factory by rigorously following all
the rules they know about. Does this parallel the experiences Cage and Feldman
had when coaxing improvised materials from performers? Performance practice
suffuses the interpretation of any score.

PROMPT: "Both perspectives are valid and necessary for artistic creation, even
though hyperconnectivity allows us to take a glimpse, with genuine enthusiasm,
of new ways to explore reality through unusual horizons for human interaction."

Translation "boy it is really exciting to interact with people in new ways."

To what extent do we agree with the sentiment? Or with the enthusiasm of the
sentiment? What does hyperconnectivity get us? It gets us hyperconnectivity.
And then what?

Working collaboratively in the presence of a structure: the examples of
planning the through-time details of music: counterpoint, harmony, the
beginnings and endings of things. Whatever your medium, if you are working with
a team of people then the need for modeling things becomes essential. (Think
about the centrality of models in architecture.) In these cases then
collaborators are collaborating through the model, ie, through a structure. In
a Bruno Latour sense the model becomes an actor. Is this what Chaya and Steve
are getting at when they advise young composers to ask musical materials what
musical materials want.

###

Composers collaborate but it is frequently hidden: it is a problem that Hans
Zimmer is actually thirty people. In the visual arts the idea of the studio of
helpersiswas largely accepted. The same with architecture. But somehow not in
music. Why do not composition studios work the way that the studios of
architects work? Or painters? Or sculptors? All these situations are
works-for-hire.

Note, however, that we have a pedagogical model in music composition: "I study
in the studio of so-and-so." So pedagogical lineage exists in composition. But
this seems not to translate into the same types of collaborative work as in
many of the other arts.

###

PROMPT: "The agents of the humanities, sciences, engineering and the arts
inhabit this context facing a dilemma: to perceive it as an overwhelming
network that communicates them with an extremely wide community of artists from
different areas of knowledge, or take it as an area for dialogue and relevant
transdisciplinary collaboration."

Another false dichotomy?

We have used interconnectivity through social media as a way to move deeper
into our existing disciplines. Why should this be the case? Due, undoubtedly,
to existing social and economic realities.

Is the network overhwhelming? We become aware of the large number of our
potential competitors. But possibly also the large number of our potential
collaborators.

PROMPT: "The scenario also shows possible solutions: limit the scope of this
context by creating ephemeral ties, or exploit it in order to increase the
ability to reconfigure collaboration, based on solidarity and resources
provided by open source technology and communication virtual platforms."

Are we working together? Or are we a tower of Babel?

Does this come from a social concern? Will the social concerns underlying the
question translate to the production of music? When we sit a biologist, an
architect and a dancer in a room to solve a problem, what new insight arises?

Should we address the paradigm of consulting? Has international consulting
handed over to us a paradigm of consulting? Consulting is the dialectical
resolution of the two terms in tension in the most recent sentence of the
prompt, above.   

A collaborative system in which people can collaborate across languages. I can
make a bit of score, leave a note that says "fill this in", and someone else
from another country gets an automatic translation of the "fill this in" note,
and then supplies new material to the score. But would the machine translation
have to go through a vendor of for-pay machine translation services? Does this
essentially argue the case to keep all components in a system end-to-end
open-source?

Does collaborating across disciplines feel superficial? How substantial is a
musical collaboaration with marine biologists? Creative process: hang out once,
get drive of files, compose piece. What is the nature of a deep and fulfilling
transdisciplinary collaboration?

How much collaboration is enough collaboration? How much more collaboration do
we need? Is anyone liberated from existing social constraints by these new
social technologies? Are techonologies the bearers of some utopia? What does it
mean to fantasize technology-induced increases in collaboration when the social
and economic constraints of my reality prevent those increases from ever
materializing?

Do the new technologies allow us to accelerate the rate at which we establish
new collaborations?

### OTHER ###

Music notation and programming languages are complex symbolic representations
of things. So why the hell is it that writing code together works marvellously
well while writing score does not? Does some difference inhere in the
representations themselves? Are these artifacts of history or society? How will
we know the answers to these questions? And are not we now only at the doorstep
of being able to write score together?

Can we extrapolate from CG animation? Somebody renders the skeleton, somebody
else the hair, somebody else shadows. Does a sufficient model of animation
exist to enable all of this?

The comparison to Photoshop may be helpful. Lone Photoshop editor?
Collaborative Photoshop editing?

Is it that we simply have no model of what composition is?

The extent to which a technology allows you to create a parametric model of
something is exactly the extent to which a technology allows you to
collaborate.

Is it also a factor that there are so few people in the culture who are skilled
in the creation of music notation?

Why is it the case that the discussion on the LilyPond list is about how to
make the program do stuff rather than how to make music that does stuff?

### 2015-03-04 ###

We're supposed to treat technologies like they're transparent. Our discussion
of "automation" revealed how entangled the concept was with a sentiment of
Romanticism.

### OUTLINE ###

I. detailed image of the work of score creation (as we'd like to see it)

II. but none of this is possible today.

III. why not? what are the impediments that prevent us from living out this
way of working they way we dream to do so? discussion of points about why not.

* Collaboration requires a formalism and NO FORMAL MODEL OF COMPOSITION YET
EXISTS. Why is there yet no formal model of composition? Are we suspicious of a
formal model of composition? What is the meaning of Goebel's screed about
"(Jewish) academic formalism"? Are there assumptions about a (19th-century)
concept of expression that still operate and prevent the development of a
formal model of composition? There are many fields (like GCI animation) that
are already regularly collaborative. How many strawman arguments against
compositional collaboration are out there?

IV. what changes in the world will it take to get us closer to the way of
working that we dream? answer the question.
