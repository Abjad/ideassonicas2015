# Collaborative composition vignette #2

## Background

The three of us are in the middle of a piece for solo guitar. The piece has two
main sections with a hard silence in between. The total duration is about 15
minutes. The first half lasts about 10 minutes, the second half about 5
minutes. We've decided that the end of the first half should close with about a
minute and a half of two- or three-voice polyphony. It's Monday morning. We've
given ourselves all of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday together in our shared
studio space to compose the minute and a half of polyphony. The guitarist will
come to our studio on Thursday to give feedback and play through the material.

## Goal

Author a work plan for the three of us for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Reference different types of compositional work. Reference different
technologies (remembering that paper and pencil is just as much a technology as
a scripting language or a 3D printer). Show what parts of the process can and
should be collaborative.

## Work plan

Monday is chord day: morning the three of us compose chord progressions from
left to right (working in time, prototyping the whole section at scale harmonic
rhythm in time)

Monday afternoon we meet at the piano and share our prototypes to formalize
them into one generative program.

Tuesday is surface day:

morning -- we write chord to make surfaces that countenance the chords.

afternoon -- we share and fuse our surface ideas at the piano

Wednesday is selection and tweaking day:

Wednesday morning -- we generate a hundred mockups and choose the twenty we
like

Wednesday afternoon -- we collate and tweak the twenty versions we want Pablo
to play the next day.
