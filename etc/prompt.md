THEMATIC FRAMEWORK

Global interconnectedness and its tools reveal endless positions on the stage
of contemporary artistic creation: at one extreme we find the defense of the
creator’s lonely work process; on the other, the eminent search for
intersections that enable collaborative processes between artists from
different disciplines, fields and contexts. Both perspectives are valid and
necessary for artistic creation, even though hyperconnectivity allows us to
take a glimpse, with genuine enthusiasm, of new ways to explore reality through
unusual horizons for human interaction.

The agents of the humanities, sciences, engineering and the arts inhabit this
context facing a dilemma: to perceive it as an overwhelming network that
communicates them with an extremely wide community of artists from different
areas of knowledge, or take it as an area for dialogue and relevant
transdisciplinary collaboration. The scenario also shows possible solutions:
limit the scope of this context by creating ephemeral ties, or exploit it in
order to increase the ability to reconfigure collaboration, based on solidarity
and resources provided by open source technology and communication virtual
platforms. 

On the occasion of the first edition of our magazine, *Sonic Ideas*, we want to
raise the issue of *Covolución* (*Covolution*), by inviting renowned voices of
artistic creation willing to face the mentioned dilemma. *Covolución*, is a
neologism which refers to *CO-nnect* / *CO-llaborate*, and *Volution*, which
means transformation and movement. Thus, we express the desire to promote
transdisciplinary creation and reconfigure the meaning of collaboration through
the concept naming this issue of our magazine.  *Covolución*, links convergence
and evolution in a living process: a dialogue that transforms its actors into
creators, transforming as well the language they use and the platform that
hosts them. This process is an emerging force in the current scenario of our
creative possibilities. We invite you to fully present it in the first edition
of our publication.

-   We would like to suggest some questions that arose among the curators of
    this year to provide more details about this number.
-   What similarities can be found (if any) between *Open Source Software* and
    *Open Source Creation*?
-   What is the role of *transdiscipline* in contemporary art, and what do you
    think of the way we organize ourselves to collaborate with other artists?
-   Do we really employ new communication platforms for creative interaction or
    we continue to prefer solitude as creators?;
-   Are composers usually good collaborators?;
-   What is the future of collaboration in the context of contemporary music
    making?;
-   How are music and sound informing other fields of knowledge and viceversa
    ?;  
-   As composers what is our ability and real desire to generate functional
    integrated -not parallel- transdisciplinary working conditions?;
-   What are the challenges posed by transdisciplinary creation to the identity
    and responsibility inherent to the work of an author ?;
-   What happens to the identity and aesthetics of the collective work shown in
    a work created by a team or transdisciplinary community?

The creative outcomes and critical scope of these issues will arise as you
incorporate your voices to the dialogue required by the multiple, creative and
disciplinary horizon that we share.
