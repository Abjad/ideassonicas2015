What are the incentives for collaboration?

If I want artistic production to be equivalent to communication, then I'm excited about new technologies of communication.

Technology amplifies and accelerates the nature of work already undertaken. In the case where we have software that models artistic production, we see that software can make it much faster to produce the modelled cultural artifact.
