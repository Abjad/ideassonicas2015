New music, new technologies: a composers' assessment of the collaborative potential of new communication and production technologies
====================================================================================================================================

The three of us work as both composers and technologists every day: we write
our music in ways that are deeply informed by practices drawn from the
engineering disciplines and, at the same time, we bring the perspectives of our
work as composers to the ways we develop and evaluate new music technologies.
As lead developers of Abjad -- an object-oriented and open-source API for the
formalized control of music notation that extends the widely used Python
programming language and that has now been downloaded thousands of times by
composers all around the world -- we have had years to reflect on the ways that
computing technologies both help and hinder our work as artists. Our concerns
range from the technical (how can the interface to a class be optimized to
express the ways that rhythmic augmentation dots work in conjunction with
differently shaped noteheads?) to the properly social (what are the ways that
consumer computing technologies exert their alien pull on our work as artists
and what strategies do we have in place to subvert these tendencies of new
technology?). Here we turn our attention to the things that our work as
composers and technologists tells us about the ways that the collaborative
potential of music composition intersects the new communication and production
technologies now avilable to us. Under what circumstances is music composition
collaborative? Which of the new technoloiges that now surround us hold the
potential to amplify the collaborative parts of our work as composers? And how
do we navigate the differences between the technologies that help us produce
our work and those that help us facilitate our increasingly global
relationships with collaborators? These are the types of questions we consider
below.

Even though the ways that we each compose our music each makes heavy use of the
tools of open-source development -- a number of different programming
languages, integrated development environments, hosted repositories and a
collection of unit and regression test practices, to name a few -- we are, in
part, technoskeptics. In our work as developers of Abjad we are deeply
committed to making the received cultural knowledge of more than 1000 years of
music notation amenable to computation. But we do this not because of an
interest in technology itself but as a way of helping streamline the sometimes
incredibly detailed work of writing music. Consider the case of the composer
realizing relatively late in the compositional process that hundreds of events
in a complex musical texture must change in some systematic way as a result of
a deeper listening to the inner ear and a developing understanding of the piece
as it is being composed. Making such changes on paper is at least tedious and
at worst an active deterrent to bettering the music. The situation with the
available computer-based music notation programs is hardly any better. What is
needed instead is a way systematically -- and indeed even syntactically -- to
model the relationships between different events in even extremely complex
musical score such that all events related in a musically meaningful way can be
changed at once in response to the realizations (or imaginings) of the
composer. This is one of the primary design imperatives of Abjad. But note that
this sort of structural approach to modeling the relationships between entities
in musical score derives not form new technologies but from old compositional
problems: we chose to model our music with code because code helps clarify
complex musical relationships in our music and thereby make musical
relationships easier to elaborate as we compose. This is not a posture that
derives from an interest in technology. And, in fact, if a
non-computationally-oriented way of solving our compositional probems were
available we would consider it immediately.
