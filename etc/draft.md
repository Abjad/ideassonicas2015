New music, new technologies: a composers' assessment of the collaborative potential of new communication and production technologies
====================================================================================================================================

The three of us work as both composers and technologists every day: we write
our music in ways that are deeply informed by practices drawn from the
engineering disciplines and, at the same time, we bring the perspectives of our
work as composers to the ways we develop and evaluate new music technologies.
As lead developers of Abjad -- an object-oriented and open-source API for the
formalized control of music notation that extends the widely used Python
programming language and that has now been downloaded thousands of times by
composers all around the world -- we have had years to reflect on the ways that
computing technologies both help and hinder our work as artists. Our concerns
range from the technical (how can the interface to a class be optimized to
express the ways that rhythmic augmentation dots work in conjunction with
differently shaped noteheads?) to the properly social (what are the ways that
consumer computing technologies exert their alien pull on our work as artists
and what strategies do we have in place to subvert these tendencies of new
technology?). Here we turn our attention to the things that our work as
composers and technologists tells us about the ways that the collaborative
potential of music composition intersects the new communication and production
technologies now avilable to us. Under what circumstances is music composition
collaborative? Which of the new technoloiges that now surround us hold the
potential to amplify the collaborative parts of our work as composers? And how
do we navigate the differences between the technologies that help us produce
our work and those that help us facilitate our increasingly global
relationships with collaborators? These are the types of questions we consider
below.

Even though the ways that we each compose our music each makes heavy use of the
tools of open-source development -- a number of different programming
languages, integrated development environments, hosted repositories and a
collection of unit and regression test practices, to name a few -- we are, in
part, technoskeptics. In our work as developers of Abjad we are deeply
committed to making the received cultural knowledge of more than 1000 years of
music notation amenable to computation. But we do this not because of an
interest in technology itself but as a way of helping streamline the sometimes
incredibly detailed work of writing music. Consider the case of the composer
realizing relatively late in the compositional process that hundreds of events
in a complex musical texture must change in some systematic way as a result of
a deeper listening to the inner ear and a developing understanding of the piece
as it is being composed. Making such changes on paper is at least tedious and
at worst an active deterrent to bettering the music. The situation with the
available computer-based music notation programs is hardly any better. What is
needed instead is a way systematically -- and indeed even syntactically -- to
model the relationships between different events in even extremely complex
musical score such that all events related in a musically meaningful way can be
changed at once in response to the realizations (or imaginings) of the
composer. This is one of the primary design imperatives of Abjad. But note that
this sort of structural approach to modeling the relationships between entities
in musical score derives not from new technologies but from old compositional
problems: we chose to model our music with code because code helps clarify
complex musical relationships in our music and thereby make musical
relationships easier to elaborate as we compose. This is not a posture that
derives from an interest in technology. And, in fact, if a
non-computationally-oriented way of solving our compositional problems were
available we would consider it immediately.

We now pause to consider the case of compositional collaboration
transhistorically. It is striking that cases of composerly collaboration across
the centuries bring the composer together with
agents of allied disciplines but not with other composers (which could be desirable simply for the reason of enjoying each others' company, learning from each other, and arriving at ideas iteratively through discussion and fruitful, articulate disagreement, in addition to less probable expectations of streamlined production).  Opera joins composer, conductor, librettist,
singers, players, an impresario, critics, marketers and a whole chain of
financial functionaries to underwrite and the work as it is readied for stage.
Singer / songwriter colloborations have for years toiled in moonlighting stints at hotels, knocking off song after song working closely together. And obviously composers have collaborated intimately with event curators and musical performers throughout history. But the pressing point in these (and other) historically recognizable examples of composerly collaboration is that the
composer acts in conjunction not with another composer but with agents of other
disciplines altogether. We can dub this the 'lone composer' phenomenon as a
type of shorthand. And then we may ask why this phenomenon of the lone composer is overwhelmingly the historical
norm for notated, western music. Asked another way, what makes the image of two composers working together
on the same score at the same desk so uncommon as to be historically
negligible? Does the answer lie in a changing understanding of compositional
collaboration over time? Or is there something inherently isolating in the work
of composition itself?

In talking about the artistic potentials of new technologies, we should be careful to preserve and then challenge a distinction between technologies that enable communication, on the one hand, and technologies that enable content-creation, on the other. The crucial difference is that communications technologies describe what kind of messages can be sent without describing the nature of their content -- I don't need a computational object model of the English language to send a text message -- while content-creation technologies depend heavily on models of certain kinds of content, i.e. Adobe software that models books, magazines, and posters, or Abjad's model of the musical score.

If our knowledge of notated compositional practice in the first fifteen years of the twenty-first century gives us any useful information, neither content-creation technologies nor communications technologies of the last fifteen years have made composer-composer collaboration any more likely, probably because they adhere unthinkingly to a split between communication and content-creation technologies. It is, after all, precisely when collaboration occurs that our distinction begins to blur, as collaborators need to communicate with each other about the content they craft together. But new social media tools haven't embedded robust models of musical notation, and new content-creation tools haven't embedded utilities for version tracking or comparison, let alone basics like user profiles that lend transparency to group work, and collaboration between workers with the same skills remains hellishly redundant. It speaks volumes of the metaphor "too many cooks in the kitchen" that one can simply imagine two cooks to meet the metaphor's requirements, and it remains a major challenge of software systems to enable similarly skilled workers to collaborate on an artifact they each have been trained to create autonomously.

# TODO: what probably makes sense next is to elaborate a bit of the difference
# between "production technologies" and "communication technologies" . Do that
# first. Then ask whether new production technologies (be they Finale,
# Sibelius, Abjad, Illustrator, Photoshop, Logic or whatever) stand to make
# composer-to-composer collaboration more likely. Then ask whether new
# communications technologies (email, text, social media of all sorts ... and
# before them simply phone and fax) stand to make composer-to-composer
# collaboration more likely. The answer to both question is probably that the
# technologies *only marginally* (at best) stand to increase
# composer-to-composer collaboration.

# AND THEN the next step is probably to ask whether either type of new
# technology (production or communciation) stand to increase "traditional"
# composerly collaboration (ie, not composer-to-composer but
# composer-to-other-type-of-collaborator). The answer is probably that the new
# production technologies probably help create new types of music but may not
# increase the incidence of collaboration; and the second part of the answer is
# probably that new communications technologies definitely increase the SPEED
# (or rate) of traditional collaboration but probably only marginally increase
# the INCIDENCE of collaboration.
