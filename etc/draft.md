New music, new technologies: a composers' assessment of the collaborative potential of new content-creation and communications technologies
===========================================================================================================================================

The three of us work as both composers and technologists every day: we write
our music in ways that are deeply informed by practices drawn from the
engineering disciplines and, at the same time, we bring the perspectives of our
work as composers to the ways we develop and evaluate new music technologies.
As lead developers of Abjad -- an object-oriented and open-source API for the
formalized control of music notation that extends the widely used Python
programming language and that has now been downloaded thousands of times by
composers all around the world -- we have had years to reflect on the ways that
computing technologies both help and hinder our work as artists. Our concerns
range from the technical (how can the interface to a class be optimized to
express the ways that rhythmic augmentation dots work in conjunction with
differently shaped noteheads?) to the properly social (what are the ways that
consumer computing technologies exert their alien pull on our work as artists
and what strategies do we have in place to subvert these tendencies of new
technology?). Here we turn our attention to the things that our work as
composers and technologists tells us about the ways that the collaborative
potential of music composition intersects the new communication and production
technologies now avilable to us. Under what circumstances is music composition
collaborative? Which of the new technoloiges that now surround us hold the
potential to amplify the collaborative parts of our work as composers? And how
do we navigate the differences between the technologies that help us produce
our work and those that help us facilitate our increasingly global
relationships with collaborators? These are the types of questions we consider
below.

Even though the ways that we each compose our music each makes heavy use of the
tools of open-source development -- a number of different programming
languages, integrated development environments, hosted repositories and a
collection of unit and regression test practices, to name a few -- we are, in
part, technoskeptics. In our work as developers of Abjad we are deeply
committed to making the received cultural knowledge of more than 1000 years of
music notation amenable to computation. But we do this not because of an
interest in technology itself but as a way of helping streamline the sometimes
incredibly detailed work of writing music. Consider the case of the composer
realizing relatively late in the compositional process that hundreds of events
in a complex musical texture must change in some systematic way as a result of
a deeper listening to the inner ear and a developing understanding of the piece
as it is being composed. Making such changes on paper is at least tedious and
at worst an active deterrent to bettering the music. The situation with the
available computer-based music notation programs is hardly any better. What is
needed instead is a way systematically -- and indeed even syntactically -- to
model the relationships between different events in even extremely complex
musical score such that all events related in a musically meaningful way can be
changed at once in response to the realizations (or imaginings) of the
composer. This is one of the primary design imperatives of Abjad. But note that
this sort of structural approach to modeling the relationships between entities
in musical score derives not from new technologies but from old compositional
problems: we chose to model our music with code because code helps clarify
complex musical relationships in our music and thereby make musical
relationships easier to elaborate as we compose. This is not a posture that
derives from an interest in technology. And, in fact, if a
non-computationally-oriented way of solving our compositional problems were
available we would consider it immediately.

We now pause to consider the case of compositional collaboration
transhistorically. It is striking that cases of composerly collaboration across
the centuries bring the composer together with agents of allied disciplines but
not with other composers (which could be desirable simply for the reason of
enjoying each others'' company, learning from each other, and arriving at ideas
iteratively through discussion and fruitful, articulate disagreement, in
addition to less probable expectations of streamlined production). Opera joins
composer, conductor, librettist, singers, players, an impresario, critics,
marketers and a whole chain of financial functionaries to underwrite and the
work as it is readied for stage. Singer / songwriter colloborations have for
years toiled in moonlighting stints at hotels, knocking off song after song
working closely together. And obviously composers have collaborated intimately
with event curators and musical performers throughout history. But the pressing
point in these (and other) historically recognizable examples of composerly
collaboration is that the composer acts in conjunction not with another
composer but with agents of other disciplines altogether. We can dub this the
'lone composer' phenomenon as a type of shorthand. And then we may ask why this
phenomenon of the lone composer is overwhelmingly the historical norm for
notated, western music. Asked another way, what makes the image of two
composers working together on the same score at the same desk so uncommon as to
be historically negligible? Does the answer lie in a changing understanding of
compositional collaboration over time? Or is there something inherently
isolating in the work of composition itself?

In talking about the artistic potentials of new technologies, we should be
careful to preserve and then challenge a distinction between content-creation
technologies and communications technologies. Content-creation technologies
depend heavily on computational models of certain realworld artifacts and their
use. (We see that this is the case when we consider the model of a magazine and
its pages provided by Adobe System''s InDesign or when we examine the model of
musical score implemented in Abjad.) Communications technologies, by contrast,
describe the format and transmission of information without any corresponding
reliance on (or need for) a computational model of the meaning of the
information transmitted: email and text messaging allow the rapid transmission
of natural language utterances without any model the meaning of natural
language whatever.

[Having the underscored the distinction between content-creation technologies
and communications technologies in this way, it is perhaps worth pointing out
that the two categories of technology underwent periods of rapid expansion at
different times.]

If our knowledge of notated compositional practice in the first fifteen years
of the present century gives us any useful information, neither the newest of
content-creation technologies nor communications technologies have made
composer-composer collaboration any more likely. And we observe that this may
be due in large measure to the fact that so many of the new technologies adhere
unthinkingly to a split between content creation and communications. It is,
after all, precisely when collaboration occurs that our distinction begins to
blur, as collaborators need to communicate shared content. But new social media
tools haven''t embedded robust models of musical notation. Nor have new
content-creation tools embedded utilities for version tracking or comparison,
let alone basics like user profiles that lend transparency to group work. 
Collaboration between workers with the same skills remains hellishly redundant.
It speaks volumes of the metaphor "too many cooks in the kitchen" that one can
simply imagine two cooks to meet the metaphor''s requirements. And it remains a
major challenge of software systems to enable similarly skilled workers to
collaborate on an artifact they each have been trained to create autonomously.

# TODO: what probably makes sense next is to elaborate a bit of the difference
# between "content-creation technologies" and "communications technologies" .
# Do that first. Then ask whether new production technologies (be they Finale,
# Sibelius, Abjad, Illustrator, Photoshop, Logic or whatever) stand to make
# composer-to-composer collaboration more likely. Then ask whether new
# communications technologies (email, text, social media of all sorts ... and
# before them simply phone and fax) stand to make composer-to-composer
# collaboration more likely. The answer to both question is probably that the
# technologies *only marginally* (at best) stand to increase
# composer-to-composer collaboration.

# AND THEN the next step is probably to ask whether either type of new
# technology (content-creation or communciation) stand to increase
# "traditional" composerly collaboration. The answer is probably that the new
# content-creation technologies probably help create new types of music but may
# not increase the incidence of collaboration. The second part of the answer is
# probably that new communications technologies increase the RATE of
# traditional collaboration but probably only marginally increase the INCIDENCE
# of traditional collaboration.
