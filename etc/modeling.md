Modeling is the correct extent of techno-determinism. Good models enable both solo and collaborative artistic creativity. Good models allow independent consciousnesses to share their efforts. By collaboratively modeling relevant artistic objects and processes, artists create a language together.

Software can't help unless there's a model. Adobe implemented software models of culturally understood cultural artifacts, such as books and magazines. Later, they extended these models with new metaphors that referred just to the digital, such as channels. Abjad models musical scores. 

Time-based media software models time. Cinema programs implement a model of storyboarding film production first used by the studio system in the first part of the twentieth century.

We locate collaboration in social networks. Good object models enable use by a variety of social configuraitons, including single actors.

Communication software systems have larger user communities than content production software systems; many people want to communicate, but comparably fewer users want to produce artistic content. Communication technologies should be content agnostic, but content production software systems are not communications technologies. They're explicitly content-oriented and constrain artistic production.

It's artistic collaboration that begins to muddy the distinction between communication and content-production.
