Music composition and the technologies of working together: towards an assessment of technology's impact on the structure and incidence of collaborative music composition
==========================================================================================================================================================================

How are collaborative efforts at music composition impacted by the increasing
availability of technology? And how is the relationship between composerly
collaboration and technology likely to develop in the future?

Attempts at an answer depend on which technologies we mean when we ask the
question and, crucially, on what we imagine composerly collaboration to be. In
the paragraphs that follow we consider the status of collaborative work in
music composition. Then we turn our attention to the ways that the increasing
availability of technology stands to impact this work. Our reflections will
taxonomize collaborative work by disciplinary orientation and classify
technologies according to design. Supplied with this pair of distinctions --
the first based on types of collaborative work and the second based on the
likely applications of technology -- we sketch a vision of collaboration in
music composition that celebrates the social aspects of collaborative work over
and above the development of new technologies, whether in the arts or
elsewhere.

The three of us work as both composers and technologists every day. We write
our music in ways that are informed by practices drawn from software
engineering. And we bring the perspectives of our work as composers to the way
we develop the technologies we use in our own music and that we make available
to other composers. As the primary developers of Abjad -- an open-source,
object-oriented API for the formalized control of music notation that extends
the widely used Python programming language and that has now been downloaded
thousands of times by composers all around the world -- we have a position
overlapping both the arts and engineering from which to reflect on the ways
that computing technologies both help and hinder our work as artists. Our
concerns range from the technical (how can the interface to a class be
optimized to express the ways that rhythmic augmentation dots work in
conjunction with differently shaped noteheads?) to the properly social (what
are the ways that consumer computing technologies exert their alien pull on our
work as artists and what strategies do we have in place to subvert these
tendencies of new technology?). It is from this perspective that we pause to
reflect on the nature of collaboration in music composition generally. When is
music composition collaborative? Are we able to discern different types of
composerly collaboration? And what does collaborative work in music composition
look like?

Cases of composerly collaboration almost always bring the composer together not
with other composers but with practitioners of allied disciplines. Opera is
certainly one of the clearest -- and most historically reified -- examples.
Opera joins composer, conductor, librettist, singers and players with managers,
marketers and a whole chain of financial functionaries necessary to underwrite
the production as it is readied for stage. Dancers and stage and lighting
directors extend the project further. And, indeed, the number of roles allowed
by operatic production can probably be multiplied indefinitely. Opera has
always been collaborative and the composer has always occupied a central
position in the production. And this joining together of agents from such an
array of different practices points to the inherently transdisciplinary nature
of opera and the composer's role in its production. But note that what is
almost never the case is the production of an opera authored by more than one
composer. There are cases of composers completing each other's scores, both
operatic and otherwise, especially posthumously. But the composer's role in the
overwhelming majority of cases of operatic production, both at the present
moment and in the past, is essentially a unary role embedded in some larger
transciplinary collaboration.

Is there something inherent in the nature of opera that embeds the composer
alone in the middle of a social network of collaborators taken from other
disciplines? The role of the composer as film scorer recapitulates everything
we observe in opera. And the coproduction of songs further convinces us of the
transdisplinary nature of compositional collaboration when we think of the
composer at one desk and the lyricist at the next, toiling in moonlighting
stints at a hotel, knocking off song after song. Here we find the composer
embedded in an intimate social network of only two collaborators. But only one
composer. And only in collaboration across disciplines rather than within them.

Is there room to imagine collaboration within composition rather than
collaboration across the boundaries of composition? Two composers sitting at
the same desk co-creating the details of the same score at more or less the
same time is almost unattested. Such composer-to-composer collaboration would
constitute a type of intradisciplinary collaboration in music composition. But
intradisciplinary composition is not at all what we find when we reflect on
composerly collaboration. What we find instead are overwhelmingly cases of
transdisciplinarity in music composition.

We're not sure why this is the case. The historical and continued persistence
of transciplinarity in preference to intradisciplinarity in compositional
collaboration is at least something of a mystery. The baggage left over from
Romanticism surely continues to prop up an outdated ideal of the (necessarily
lone) composer-genius. But the shadow of Romanticism, no matter how it
intersects the impenetrability of contemporary commodification, can't explain
the norm of the lone composer embedded transcriplinarily in the production of
the stage works of, say, the Renaissance or the Baroque. There's the very real
possibility that composers have avoided composer-to-composer collaboration
simply for reasons of not wanting to collaborate in such a way. The production
of paintings and novels tends to exhibit the same pattern of lone authorship we
observe in music composition. And so perhaps the preference for lone authorship
is a creative preference that (whether the result of varied types of elitism or
not) is not merely the baggage of Romanticism but in fact a a well-attested
pattern in our creative history. We are probably forced to admit that this is
at least partially the case.

But in the present moment we feel that something substantial has changed.
Decades after the (discourse of the) death of the author and the beginnings of
the first attempts to take seriously emergent types of political pluralism, we
detect a manifest desire on the part of very many creators in all media to
interrogate the older patterns of production and try out newer ones in their
place. In the domain of musical production we observe that producer-to-producer
collaboration in the creation of electronica is not at all uncommon. Sending
samples back and forth across the Internet has benefitted DJs and producers
enormously. And indeed one of the collateral benefits of the rise of fixed
media generally would appear to be cases of precisely this sort of
intradiscipliarity for which we search mostly in vain in composition proper.
And the persistence of the terms "composer" and "producer" as distinct from one
another is telling. The culture continues to designate as composers those who
author musical score destined for live performance while reserving the term
producer for those working in the fixed-media creation of audio: celebrated
cases of producer-to-producer intradisciplinarity are common enough while
corresponding cases of composer-to-composer intradisciplinarity are still very
much exceptions to the persistence of a cultural norm.

Before leaving our reflections on the types of composerly collaboration and
their distribution we would like to suggest one further -- and largely
unacknolwedged -- reason that composer-to-composer collaboration may occur so
infrequently. The reason has to do with the nature of music notation in itself.
Our experience implementing Abjad as a type of object-oriented interface to the
structure of musical score has convinced us of the complexity of modeling music
notation as a coherent system. The fact that children can read and write music
notation competently attests to the systematic nature of at least the primary
features of music notation. But generalizing those systematic qualities into a
coherent formal model is a much more complex task. What type of model best
exhibits the understanding of music horizontally and vertically at the same
time? What type of context must be modeled to spell accidentals correctly
according to composers' manifestly different uses of pitch? Are measures to be
modeled as containers of content or demarcators of musical time? What are the
semantics of beams, ties and the other details of rhythmic notation in
nonmetric musics? These are nontrivial considerations that have bedeviled the
authors of the various music notation and composition systems now available.
And so we offer the possibility that a largely unacknoweldged attenuator of
intradisciplinary collaboration in music composition may be the difficulty of
producing a computational model of music notation in itself. DJs and producers
may find it as convenient as it is to send audio files over the Internet -- and
then iteratively to modify and resend such files -- precisely because our
current cultural understanding of what digital audio *is* is remarkably simpler
than any corresponding model of music notation.

Even though the ways that we each compose our music each makes heavy use of the
tools of open-source development -- a number of different programming
languages, integrated development environments, hosted repositories and a
collection of unit and regression test practices, to name a few -- we are, in
part, technoskeptics. In our work as developers of Abjad we are deeply
committed to making the received cultural knowledge of more than 1000 years of
music notation amenable to computation. But we do this not because of an
interest in technology itself but as a way of helping streamline the sometimes
incredibly detailed work of writing music. Consider the case of the composer
realizing relatively late in the compositional process that hundreds of events
in a complex musical texture must change in some systematic way as a result of
a deeper listening to the inner ear and a developing understanding of the piece
as it is being composed. Making such changes on paper is at least tedious and
at worst an active deterrent to bettering the music. The situation with the
available computer-based music notation programs is hardly any better. What is
needed instead is a way systematically -- and indeed even syntactically -- to
model the relationships between different events in even extremely complex
musical score such that all events related in a musically meaningful way can be
changed at once in response to the realizations (or imaginings) of the
composer. This is one of the primary design imperatives of Abjad. But note that
this sort of structural approach to modeling the relationships between entities
in musical score derives not from new technologies but from old compositional
problems: we chose to model our music with code because code helps clarify
complex musical relationships in our music and thereby make musical
relationships easier to elaborate as we compose. This is not a posture that
derives from an interest in technology. And, in fact, if a
non-computationally-oriented way of solving our compositional problems were
available we would consider it immediately.

In talking about the artistic potentials of new technologies, we should be
careful to preserve and then challenge a distinction between content-creation
technologies and communications technologies. Content-creation technologies
depend heavily on computational models of certain realworld artifacts and their
use. (We see that this is the case when we consider the model of a magazine and
its pages provided by Adobe System''s InDesign or when we examine the model of
musical score implemented in Abjad.) Communications technologies, by contrast,
describe the format and transmission of information without any corresponding
reliance on (or need for) a computational model of the meaning of the
information transmitted: email and text messaging allow the rapid transmission
of natural language utterances without any model the meaning of natural
language whatever.

[Having the underscored the distinction between content-creation technologies
and communications technologies in this way, it is perhaps worth pointing out
that the two categories of technology underwent periods of rapid expansion at
different times.]

If our knowledge of notated compositional practice in the first fifteen years
of the present century gives us any useful information, neither the newest of
content-creation technologies nor communications technologies have made
composer-composer collaboration any more likely. And we observe that this may
be due in large measure to the fact that so many of the new technologies adhere
unthinkingly to a split between content creation and communications. It is,
after all, precisely when collaboration occurs that our distinction begins to
blur, as collaborators need to communicate shared content. But new social media
tools haven''t embedded robust models of musical notation. Nor have new
content-creation tools embedded utilities for version tracking or comparison,
let alone basics like user profiles that lend transparency to group work. 
Collaboration between workers with the same skills remains hellishly redundant.
It speaks volumes of the metaphor "too many cooks in the kitchen" that one can
simply imagine two cooks to meet the metaphor''s requirements. And it remains a
major challenge of software systems to enable similarly skilled workers to
collaborate on an artifact they each have been trained to create autonomously.

# TODO: what probably makes sense next is to elaborate a bit of the difference
# between "content-creation technologies" and "communications technologies" .
# Do that first. Then ask whether new production technologies (be they Finale,
# Sibelius, Abjad, Illustrator, Photoshop, Logic or whatever) stand to make
# composer-to-composer collaboration more likely. Then ask whether new
# communications technologies (email, text, social media of all sorts ... and
# before them simply phone and fax) stand to make composer-to-composer
# collaboration more likely. The answer to both question is probably that the
# technologies *only marginally* (at best) stand to increase
# composer-to-composer collaboration.

# AND THEN the next step is probably to ask whether either type of new
# technology (content-creation or communciation) stand to increase
# "traditional" composerly collaboration. The answer is probably that the new
# content-creation technologies probably help create new types of music but may
# not increase the incidence of collaboration. The second part of the answer is
# probably that new communications technologies increase the RATE of
# traditional collaboration but probably only marginally increase the INCIDENCE
# of traditional collaboration.

Here we turn our attention to the things that our work as composers and
technologists tells us about the ways that the collaborative potential of music
composition intersects the new content-creation and communication technologies
now avilable to us. Under what circumstances is music composition
collaborative? Which of the new technoloiges that now surround us hold the
potential to amplify the collaborative parts of our work as composers? And how
do we navigate the differences between the technologies that help us produce
our work and those that help us facilitate our increasingly global
relationships with collaborators? These are the types of questions we consider
below.
