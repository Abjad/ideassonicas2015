Are there barriers to collaboration?

Simple economic structures prohibit collaboration by disciplining artistic workers: two artists working in different disciplines at a university cannot teach a course together, because the university prohibits it, on the grounds that this is a less efficient use of teaching resources. People prefer to work on a single project, because strategies of context switching require mental energy. 

Without talking directly about economics, the barrier is agreeing that work on the same thing. Collaboration only works with a shared set of aesthetic goals. Creative collaboration doesn't happen because people don't want the same thing. This is why editorial emperorship persists. Or there aren't barriers to collaboration: lack of collaboration is by choice, not because there's a big barrier standing in the way, and possibilities of collaboration are accidents of social network membership.

None of these things have to do with technology. They precede the tools used in collaboration, and technology would only impact this by speeding up or smoothing out social friction points. Even in working in a repository together, it's possible for people to fail to agree on common goals.

Technology does not reconfigure the social relationships between artistic collaborators, but it lubricates the existing structural relationships.
