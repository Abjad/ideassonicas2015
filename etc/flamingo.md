Open Source Software and Open Source Creation?
==============================================

"Release early, release often." So goes a best practice at the heart of open
source software production. The idea is that software is complex and that the
ways that people use software are complex, too: so release
early and release often as a way of getting even very early implementations of
software into the hands of your users.

Why does this work? Probably for reasons having to do with getting and giving
feedback. When we release even provisional versions of a technology to our
users we find out how users use our software and what they think of it. And no
matter how detailed a development process and no matter how careful our
considerations of our users, real user feedback tends frequently to surprise.
MIDI output is not nearly as important as we thought but the tools for rhythmic
quantization get a lot of use; no one uses our templating tools but the classes
we implemented for rhythmic construction are a frequent topic of conversation
on the project mailing list.

Honest user feedback helps steer the development priorities of open source
development towards a middle ground that best accommodates both the expertise
of developers and needs of users at sometimes very different levels of
experience. These are probably the reasons for the dictum. Release early,
release often. Allow yourselves to be surprised by what your users do and allow
what you learn to shape your work.

Release early, release often: what are the equivalents of the dictum in the
midst of artistic production?
